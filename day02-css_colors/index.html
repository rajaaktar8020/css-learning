        <p>HTML is a standardised system for tagging text files that creates the structure for just about every page
            that we find and use on the web. It’s HTML that adds in page breaks, paragraphs, bold lettering, italics,
            and more. HTML works to build this structure by using tags that tell browsers what to do with text. </p>
