        <p class="para">A font is a specific, digital or physical set of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) sharing
            a particular
            typeface design, style, weight, and size, such as "Arial Bold 12pt". Fonts are essential for visual
            communication, affecting readability, tone, and brand identity. They are categorized into serif, sans-serif,
            script, and display types.

            <p id="body">We've seen various units in CSS so far used for many different purposes; we did hit and trial
                to find the
                correct dimensions of that unit for our website.
            </p>
            <p id="root">In CSS rem stands for “root em”, a unit of measurement that represents the font size of the
                root element. This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element, which for most browsers has
                a default value of 16px. Using rem can help ensure consistency of font size and spacing throughout your
                UI
